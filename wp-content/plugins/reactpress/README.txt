Easily create, build and deploy React apps into your existing WordPress sites. 

== Description ==

Easily create, build and deploy React apps into your existing WordPress sites.

Get started in seconds and develop your React app with instant feedback and your WordPress theme in mind.

Combine the flexibility of WordPress with the UI capabilities of React and seamlessly integrate create-react-app into your WordPress project for your next SaaS.

ReactPress does 3 things:

* It integrates your local dev server into your WordPress theme, that you have instant feedback, how your React app looks in the context of your WordPress website.
* It builds your React app in a way that it is usable from your WordPress site.
* It makes it easy to upload your app to a live server after building.

=== System Requirements ===

To develop React apps your WordPress instance needs access to:

* the PHP function `shell_exec` and `exec`,

* and a POSIX compatible system ([Windows users can use WSL2](https://rockiger.com/en/windows-survival-guide-to-for-react-and-web-developers/ "Windows Survival Guide for React and Web Developers")).

=== Development ===

Active development of this plugin is handled [on GitHub](https://github.com/rockiger/reactpress/).

=== Documentation ===

You find a more detailed getting started guide at: [
Getting Started With ReactPress](https://rockiger.com/en/reactpress/getting-started/) ).

To create and deploy your first app:

1. Install ReactPress on your local WordPress installation.

2. In your command line use npx create-react-app [your-app-name] in the apps directory of ReactPress, e.g. `[path-to-WordPress]/wp-content/reactpress/apps/my-app`

3. Reload the ReactPress admin page and add a URL Slug for your app.

4. In the command line start the React app with `npm start` or `yarn start`.

5. Develop your app, changes will automatically hot reloaded.

6. When you are finished, build the app from the command line. You can now see your app embedded in your WordPress instance. Open it at [your-domain]/[your-slug].

7. To deploy, Install ReactPress on live WordPress site.

8. Upload the build folder from your dev system under `.../wp-content/reactpress/apps/[your-app-name]` to the same directory onto your live server. No need for create-react-app.

9. Reload the ReactPress admin page and add a URL Slug for your app.

10. Open the React app under [your-domain]/[your-slug].

Repeat steps 6 to 10 when you have new releases you want to deploy.


== Installation ==


1. Like any other plugin install via *Plugins/Add New*. You can download the plugin via admin or upload it to the plugins directory.

2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress

== Upgrade Notice ==

Release 2.0.0+ does change to way to use ReactPress and gives you much more control. It make the use of client-side routing much more transparent.

Upgrades should be smoothless. Unfortunately, backward compatibility has to be broken for that. Downgrading could be problematic.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= How do I make react-router work =

To make client-side routing work, follow this guide: [Client-Side Routing with ReactPress](https://rockiger.com/en/reactpress/client-side-routing/)

= Where do I go for support on your plugin? =

Please visit our [support forum](https://wordpress.org/support/plugin/reactpress/) and search for your problem. If you can't find any help there, feel free to create another topic. 

= Is ReactPress compatible with my theme? =

ReactPress should work with every theme. Depending on the page template you choose you will have a clean slate without any styling or a normal page that inherits the styling of your theme.

You can than style your React app with every styling solution for React that best fits your needs.


== Screenshots ==


1. Empty admin view.

2. The new React app is created.

3. The local React dev server is running on port: 3000. Every change will hot reload immediately.

4. The React app is deployed on the public server.
